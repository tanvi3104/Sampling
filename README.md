## Description

This notebook, `102213024_Tanvi.ipynb`, provides an in-depth exploration of various **sampling techniques** used in statistical analysis and data science.

### Key Highlights:
- Detailed **step-by-step implementation** of sampling methods using Python.
- Examples to demonstrate **how sampling affects data distribution** and inference.
- Visualization techniques to better understand sampled data versus the original dataset.
- Explanation of **when and why to use each sampling technique**:
  - **Simple Random Sampling**: Selecting a subset of data purely at random.
  - **Stratified Sampling**: Dividing the dataset into strata and sampling proportionally.
  - **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every \(n\)-th element from a list.
  - **Cluster Sampling**: Dividing the dataset into clusters and sampling entire clusters.
- Discussion of **practical applications** of these techniques in real-world scenarios, such as market research, surveys, and data preprocessing for machine learning.
- Insights on **common pitfalls in sampling** and strategies to avoid bias.
